    bio: "‘Hair stylist’ is my second career.  My first career was in dance.  It is an art of form and line, timing and technique (lots of technique).  These facets of dance are present in Hair Design.   Lines are cut; forms and silhouettes are chosen to accent a cheekbone or narrow a jawline. I attended Tint School of Makeup and Cosmetology, where I worked with professional photographers and makeup artists in addition to my hair curriculum.  And for the last eight years, I have enjoyed being a licensed hairstylist. But ‘second career’ doesn’t make it second in my heart.   I love working with curl and wave.   I am certified in the REZO technique and devacut.   Being a person with naturally curly hair (and being an adolescent during the 90’s), I grew up hating my hair.  Helping somebody learn to love their natural texture, is a mission of mine.  Everything in hair is a process, from uncovering a curl pattern to going blonde.  And it is my pleasure to help people through it.  (Hair midwife?...). Beachy, sun kissed balayage is another service I adore.   Balayage is like painting, using the lightener to mimic the angle of the sun and adding shadows to emphasize the light. But one of the things I love about hairstyling is my clients.  We share books, podcasts and  gardening tips (another of my interests). Tacoma is my home.   And my home would be incomplete without my lovely daughter, long suffering boyfriend, and last but not least, Clover and Finnegan our cats.
